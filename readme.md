#####Student:
Leo Schultz

#####Course Description:

Right now all computers, including desktops, laptops, mobile devices and supercomputers are using multi/many cores processors. The aim of this course is to provide students with knowledge and hands-on experience in developing applications software for processors with massively parallel computing resources. We will be using NVIDIA processors and the CUDATM programming tools in the lab section of the course. This is a course in programming massively parallel processors for general computation. The course will continue with a closer view of the internal organization of graphics processors and how it impacts performance.

#####Course Objectives:
To gain exposure to the diverse Parallel Programing Languages and understand the architecture of graphics processor units. To obtain the ability to develop software that will run on parallel processors.

#####Grade Calculation:

* Midtem (40%)
* Final(40%)
* Homeworks (20%)

#####Homeworks:

Homework will be assigned every week, we will discuss it on the first half hour of the following class.

#####Final Project:

To develop an application of your choice using CUDA/OpemCL. The project topics will be discussed and approved during the first week of classes. Project will be due on the last day of classes (DEC 5 23:59). The project must involve a demanding application such as mathematics- or physics-intensive simulation or other data-intensive computation, followed by some form of visualization and display of results. Deliverables: document 4 pages maximum that describes the project and electronic copies of the source code and the executable.
